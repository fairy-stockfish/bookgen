# bookgen
EPD opening book generator based on Stockfish variant forks.

Bookgen extends Fairy-Stockfish by the possibility of automatically generating opening books for all supported chess variants, including standard chess, crazyhouse, giveaway/suicide chess, atomic chess, and more. There are separate versions based on [Fairy-Stockfish](https://github.com/ianfab/bookgen/tree/fairy) (e.g., for Shogi, etc.), [multi-variant Stockfish](https://github.com/ianfab/bookgen/tree/multivariant), [official Stockfish](https://github.com/ianfab/bookgen/tree/official-stockfish), for [Seirawan chess](https://github.com/ianfab/bookgen/tree/seirawan), [Shatranj](https://github.com/ianfab/bookgen/tree/shatranj), and [Makruk](https://github.com/ianfab/bookgen/tree/makruk) that can be found on the respective branches. Several methods for generation and filtering of positions in FEN format are supported. The output format is EPD.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/ianfab/bookgen/wiki) for documentation and usage examples.
